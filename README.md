This project is a Basic GUI Calculator developed using Python's Tkinter library, designed for simple arithmetic operations. 
The calculator allows users to input two numbers and select an operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, or modulus) using dedicated buttons. 
It features an intuitive interface with labeled input fields, operator buttons, and a clear button to reset all inputs and results.

Error handling is incorporated to ensure valid numeric inputs and prevent division by zero, displaying appropriate messages for invalid operations. 
The grid-based layout ensures neat alignment of elements, making the calculator user-friendly.
This project demonstrates essential programming concepts like function handling, event-driven programming, and GUI design.
